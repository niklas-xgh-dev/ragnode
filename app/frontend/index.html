            <h2>About Ragnode</h2>
            <p>Ragnode is an advanced Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) system designed to revolutionize how we interact with domain-specific knowledge.</p>
            
            <p>Built with Python, FastAPI, and Anthropic's Claude, Ragnode processes embedded data from different domains, making information easily accessible through natural language queries or API.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Current Status</h2>
            <p>The system is currently in active development. The available chatbot interface is powered by Claude and serves as the foundation for our upcoming RAG-enhanced features.</p>
            <p>Future updates will introduce domain-specific knowledge embedding, semantic search capabilities, and advanced data retrieval mechanisms.</p>
